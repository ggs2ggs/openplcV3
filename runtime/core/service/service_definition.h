/// of functions that that your service uses.

/// for creating that thread. This further means that each service, must
/// keep only a very short lock on the glue variables so that it cannot
/// prevent the main PLC loop from accessing the variables.

/// or from start to stop. That's only because we haven't had such a need
/// yet. If that comes up, then we'll add that.
